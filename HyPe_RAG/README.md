# üß† Hypothetical Prompt Embedding RAG (HyPE) - Q2Q Retrieval

Welcome to the **Hypothetical Prompt Embedding RAG** project!  
This notebook demonstrates an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow using **Hypothetical Prompt Embeddings (HyPE)**, inspired by recent research.

## üöÄ What is HyPE?

Traditional RAG systems retrieve document chunks based on query-to-document similarity.  
**HyPE** takes a novel approach:  
- For each document chunk, it generates a set of *hypothetical questions* that the chunk could answer.
- At query time, the user‚Äôs question is embedded and matched **directly to these hypothetical questions** (Q2Q matching), rather than to the original document text.

This leads to more precise and contextually relevant retrieval, bridging the gap between user queries and document content.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Document Chunking:**  
    Documents are split into manageable chunks.

2. **Hypothetical Question Generation:**  
    For each chunk, an LLM generates essential questions that the chunk could answer.

3. **Embedding:**  
    Both hypothetical questions and user queries are embedded using a powerful embedding model.

4. **Q2Q Retrieval:**  
    At query time, the user‚Äôs question is matched against the pool of hypothetical questions using vector similarity (cosine/FAISS).

5. **Answer Generation:**  
    The most relevant chunks are used as context for the LLM to generate a final answer.
