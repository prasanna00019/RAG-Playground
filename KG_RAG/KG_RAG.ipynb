    "\n",
    "**KG-RAG** extends traditional RAG by retrieving structured **triplets (subject-predicate-object)** and building a **knowledge graph** over them. It enables more **context-aware, fact-checked, and explainable** answers from LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike vector-only RAG, KG-RAG gives the LLM a **domain model** of the data ‚Äî enabling logical reasoning, relationship understanding, and minimal hallucination.\n",
