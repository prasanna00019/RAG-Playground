    "\n",
    "This project showcases a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built with [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), enhanced with **dynamic prompt routing based on query tone or intent**. It demonstrates how a simple RAG setup can be evolved into an intelligent, user-aware system that responds in varying tones such as comparative, creative, elaborative, etc.\n",

      "Okay, let's break down what this document is saying about how Large Language Models (LLMs) generate text and how you can influence it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine an LLM is like a super-smart parrot that can predict what words should come next in a sentence. But instead of just knowing one word, it knows how likely *many* different words are to follow. It assigns a probability to each word in its \"vocabulary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here's the core idea:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The document explains that LLMs don't just pick the *single most likely* word every time. Instead, they use a process called \"sampling\" to choose the next word based on these probabilities. You can control this sampling process using settings like:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Temperature:** This controls how \"random\" or \"creative\" the LLM is.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   A **low temperature** (close to 0) makes the LLM pick the *most likely* words more often. This leads to more predictable and \"safe\" outputs. If two tokens have the same highest predicted probability, depending on how tiebreaking is implemented you may not always get the same output with temperature 0\n",
      "    *   A **high temperature** makes the LLM pick *less likely* words sometimes. This leads to more surprising, diverse, and potentially creative outputs. But be careful, too high and it becomes nonsensical! As temperature gets higher and higher, all tokens become equally likely to be the next predicted token.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Top-K:** Imagine the LLM makes a list of the probabilities of all possible next words. Top-K tells the LLM to only consider the *top K* most probable words on that list.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   A **low Top-K** (like 1) means the LLM *always* picks the single most likely word.\n",
      "    *   A **high Top-K** means the LLM can pick from a larger pool of likely words, leading to more variation. If you set top-K extremely high, like to the size of the LLM‚Äôs vocabulary, any token with a nonzero probability of being the next token will meet the top-K criteria and none are selected out.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Top-P (Nucleus Sampling):** This is similar to Top-K, but instead of picking a fixed number of words, it picks the smallest set of words whose probabilities add up to at least a certain value (P).\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   A **low Top-P** (close to 0) is similar to a low Top-K; the LLM focuses on the most probable words. If you set top-P to 0 (or a very small value), most LLM sampling implementations will then only consider the most probable token to meet the top-P criteria, making temperature and top-K irrelevant.\n",
      "    *   A **high Top-P** (close to 1) lets the LLM consider a wider range of words. If you set top-P to 1, any token with a nonzero probability of being the next token will meet the top-P criteria, and none are selected out.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In short:** These settings let you control how much freedom the LLM has when generating text. Lower values make it more focused and predictable, while higher values make it more creative and surprising.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Note:** The document also warns about a \"repetition loop bug.\" This is when the LLM gets stuck repeating the same words or phrases. It can happen with both low and high temperatures, so you might need to experiment to find the right balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The document suggests these starting points:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Coherent but Creative:** Temperature = 0.2, Top-P = 0.95, Top-K = 30\n",
      "*   **Especially Creative:** Temperature = 0.9, Top-P = 0.99, Top-K = 40\n",
      "*   **Less Creative:** Temperature = 0.1, Top-P = 0.9, Top-K = 20\n",
      "*   **Single Correct Answer (e.g., Math):** Temperature = 0\n",
      "\n",
