    "# 🚀 Multi-Document Agentic RAG Project 📄🤖\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview 📝\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that intelligently routes user queries to the most relevant document collections and tools using an agentic approach. Unlike traditional multi-document RAG pipelines that simply combine all documents into a single index, this solution creates separate vector indices for each document or document category (e.g., AWS Overview, Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, Amazon Business FAQ, Amazon Serverless). An AI agent orchestrates the workflow, leveraging classification, question decomposition, and retrieval tools to provide accurate and context-aware answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features ✨\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document Segmentation & Indexing:** 📚  \n",
    "    Each document or document category is chunked and indexed separately, allowing for targeted retrieval and minimizing irrelevant context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agentic Orchestration:** 🧠🤖  \n",
    "    An AI agent coordinates the workflow, deciding when to classify queries, break down complex questions, select the appropriate RAG engine, or fall back to web search.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intelligent Query Routing:** 🗂️➡️  \n",
    "    The agent uses a classification tool to determine which document index is most relevant for a given query, ensuring precise and efficient retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compound Question Handling:** 🧩  \n",
    "    Multi-part or complex queries are automatically split into sub-questions, each routed independently for retrieval and then synthesized into a final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tool Integration:** 🛠️  \n",
    "    The agent has access to multiple tools, including:\n",
    "    - RAG engines for each document category\n",
    "    - Query classification\n",
    "    - Question decomposition\n",
    "    - Web search as a fallback or enrichment\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modular & Extensible:** 🧱🔌  \n",
    "    New document categories or tools can be added easily without disrupting the overall workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Project Stands Out 🌟\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fine-Grained Control:** 🎯  \n",
    "    By maintaining separate indices and using intelligent routing, the system avoids the noise and inefficiency of monolithic multi-doc RAG setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agentic Reasoning:** 🧠💡  \n",
    "    The agent's ability to reason step-by-step, decompose questions, and select the best tool for each sub-task leads to more accurate and contextually relevant answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability & Maintainability:** 📈🔧  \n",
    "    The modular design allows for easy scaling to more document types or tools, and simplifies maintenance and updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced User Experience:** 😊👍  \n",
    "    Users receive concise, well-synthesized answers even for complex, multi-faceted queries, thanks to the agent's orchestration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works ⚙️\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User submits a query.** 💬\n",
    "2. **Agent determines if the query is compound.** 🕵️‍♂️  \n",
    "     - If so, it splits the query into sub-questions.\n",
    "3. **Each (sub-)question is classified** to identify the relevant document category. 🏷️\n",
    "4. **The appropriate RAG engine is invoked** to retrieve answers from the targeted index. 🤖\n",
    "5. **If needed, web search is used** to supplement or enrich the answer. 🌐\n",
    "6. **The agent synthesizes the results** and returns a clear, final answer. 📝✅\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach delivers a robust, intelligent, and extensible RAG system that goes beyond simple multi-document retrieval, offering agentic reasoning and precise information routing for superior results. 🏆"

That\\'s what Machine Learning (ML) is all about! It\\'s a\\nspecial part of computer science and artificial intelligence\\nwhere computers use data and clever instructions (algorithms) to\\nget better at tasks over time. Instead of telling the computer\\nevery single step, we give it examples, and it learns patterns\\nand builds mathematical models to make predictions or decisions\\non its own.\\nSupervised Learning\\nThink of this like learning with a very helpful teacher. In \\nSupervised Learning, you give the computer a lot of examples\\nwhere you already know the correct answer. For instance, if you\\nwant the computer to tell the difference between pictures of cats\\nand dogs, you\\'d show it many pictures, and for each one, you\\'d\\nclearly label it as \"cat\" or \"dog.\" The computer then learns from\\nthese labeled examples to predict the right answer for new\\npictures it hasn\\'t seen before. This is used for things like: * \\nClassification: Putting things into categories (like deciding if\\nan email is spam or not). * Regression: Predicting a number (like\\nguessing house prices based on size and location).\\nSemi-supervised Learning\\nThis is a clever mix! In Semi-supervised Learning, you have a\\nsmall amount of data that\\'s already labeled (like the examples in\\nSupervised Learning), but also a large amount of data that isn\\'t\\nlabeled at all. The process works like this: 1. The computer\\nfirst learns a little bit from the small amount of labeled data.\\n2. It then uses what it learned to make educated guesses and\\n\"label\" the much larger amount of unlabeled data. These are\\ncalled \"pseudo-labels\" because the computer guessed them. 3.\\nFinally, the computer combines both the original labeled data and\\nthe newly pseudo-labeled data. It then uses all of this combined\\ninformation to train a much stronger final model that can make\\ngood predictions. This is super useful when getting lots of\\nlabeled data is difficult or expensive.\\n11. \\n12.

In Unsupervised Learning, the computer\\'s\\njob is to find hidden patterns or groups within data that has no\\nlabels. It\\'s like organizing those toys into piles of similar\\nitems (e.g., all the cars together, all the dolls together)\\nwithout any prior instructions. * A main technique is Clustering,\\nwhere the computer groups similar pieces of data together. It\\ndoes this by measuring how \"alike\" different pieces of data are\\n(for example, using something called \"Euclidean distance\" to see\\nhow close two points are on a map). * An example is finding where\\nvehicles stop just by looking at their GPS trails, without anyone\\ntelling the computer where the \"stops\" are.\\nReinforcement Learning\\nThink of this like training a pet using rewards and punishments.\\nIn Reinforcement Learning, a computer program (called an \"agent\")\\nlearns by trying things out in a digital environment. If it does\\nsomething good, it gets a \"reward.\" If it does something bad, it\\ngets a \"penalty.\" The agent\\'s main goal is to learn the best\\nactions to take over time to get the most rewards.

The goal is to enable efficient teamwork towards\\nsuccessful project completion. The project manager's\\nresponsibilities include project planning, monitoring, and\\ncontrol. Estimating software cost involves determining the\\nproduct size, then estimating the effort needed based on size,\\nand finally, determining project duration and cost from the\\neffort estimate. Furthermore, compressing the delivery schedule\\ncan significantly increase human effort, while using fewer people\\nover a longer period can be beneficial.\\n Notes\\nSoftware Project Management (General)\\nGoal: Enable efficient teamwork for successful software\\nproject completion.\\nSPMP Document\\nPurpose: Documents project plans after planning phase.\\nOrganization of SPMP Document\\nIntroduction: Objectives, major functions, performance\\nissues, management & technical constraints.\\nProject Estimates: Historical data, estimation techniques,\\neffort, cost, project duration.\\nProject Resources Plan: People, hardware/software, special\\nresources.\\nSchedules: Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), task network,\\nGantt chart, PERT chart.\\nRisk Management Plan: Risk analysis, identification,\\nestimation, abatement procedures.\\nProject Tracking and Control Plan.\\nMiscellaneous Plans: Process tailoring, quality assurance.\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='d58a01c9-4b6f-450a-9d50-b4b284410972', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '2', 'file_name': 'Software_Project_Management.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/docs/Software_Project_Management.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 22498, 'creation_date': '2025-07-07', 'last_modified_date': '2025-07-07'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text=' MCQs\\nAccording to the text, what is one way experts can estimate\\nsoftware project effort? a) Using historical data from\\nsimilar projects. b) Dividing the software into components\\nand summing individual estimates. c) Applying a standard\\nformula based on lines of code. d) Consulting with the\\nproject stakeholders.\\nWhat is an example of a component unit that experts might\\ndivide a software product into for estimation purposes? a)\\nProject budget b) GUI c) Risk assessment d) Project timeline\\nThe text mentions that the staffing level during the life\\ncycle of a software product development follows what kind of\\ncurve? a) Bell curve b) Exponential curve c) Rayleigh curve\\nd) Linear curve\\nAccording to the text, when is the maximum number of\\nengineers typically required during a software product\\ndevelopment lifecycle? a) Requirements gathering b) Design\\nphase c) Coding phase d) Testing phase\\nWhat is \"Expert Judgement\" used for in software project\\nmanagement, according to the text? a) Risk mitigation b) Cost\\nestimation c) Resource allocation d) Communication planning\\nWhich of the following is NOT mentioned as a component unit\\nfor expert estimation? a) GUI b) Database module c) Data\\ncommunication module d) Project Management module\\nThe Rayleigh curve is associated with: a) Project budget\\nallocation b) Staffing levels during software development c)\\nRisk assessment probability d) Code complexity measurement\\nWhat type of team organization is mentioned in the text? a)\\nHierarchical team organization b) Matrix team organization c)\\nMixed team organization d) Agile team organization\\nThe expert judgement method relies on: a) Statistical\\nanalysis of past projects b) Intuition and experience of\\nexperts c) Automated tools for estimation d) Detailed project\\ndocumentation\\nThe staffing level in a software project typically: a)\\nRemains constant throughout the project b) Increases linearly\\nover time c) Follows a Rayleigh curve d) Decreases\\nexponentially over time\\nWhich phase of software development generally requires the\\nmost engineers, according to the text? a) Design b)\\nImplementation c) Testing d) Deployment\\n1. \\n2. \\n3. \\n4. \\n5. \\n6. \\n7. \\n8. \\n9. \\n10. \\n11.
