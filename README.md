## 📌 Featured Project: Dynamic Prompt-Aware RAG

Explore my **first RAG project**, where I started with basic LlamaIndex retrieval and evolved it into a **tone-aware, prompt-routed RAG system**.

🧠 It dynamically detects the intent of user queries — such as compare, summarize, elaborate, or creative — and routes them to the appropriate prompt template using LLM-based classification.
