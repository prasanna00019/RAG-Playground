# RAG-Playground

A curated collection of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) projects covering foundational to advanced techniques, including prompt routing, agentic reasoning, and HyDe-style retrieval.

## üóÇÔ∏è Projects Overview

| Project Name                  | Description                                                                                   | Techniques Used                                                        | Link                             |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Dynamic Prompt-Aware RAG**  | Routes user queries to the best prompt template based on intent (e.g., summarize, compare).   | Prompt routing, LLM-based intent classification, LlamaIndex            | [View](Dynamic_Prompt_Aware_RAG) |
| **Agentic Multi-Doc RAG**     | Agent breaks query into sub-questions and retrieves from relevant document-specific indices.  | ReAct agent, query decomposition, per-doc vector indices, web fallback | [View](Multi_Doc_Agentic_RAG)    |
| **HyDe RAG (Single + Multi)** | Generates hypothetical answers to improve retrieval; supports single and multi-doc averaging. | Hypothetical generation, embedding reranking, dot product similarity   | [View](HyDe_RAG)                 |
| **Corrective RAG**            | Enhances answer reliability by verifying and correcting initial RAG output. Involves an evaluator agent that scores document relevance, a query rewriter for web fallback, and a generator that produces final answers from refined knowledge. Adapts dynamically based on confidence scoring (`CORRECT`, `INCORRECT`, `AMBIGUOUS`). | Evaluator agent (embedding + LLM), knowledge strip refinement, LLM query rewriting, web search fallback, generator agent | [View](Corrective_RAG)           |
