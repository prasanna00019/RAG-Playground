    "# üöÄ Fusion RAG: Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Fusion RAG** project! This notebook demonstrates an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline inspired by the [RAG-Fusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03367) approach. The workflow leverages multiple query reformulations, document retrieval, and robust re-ranking to generate high-quality, contextually rich responses using Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß© How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Reformulation**  \n",
    "    For a user's input query, we generate _n_ semantically diverse sub-queries to cover different aspects of the information need.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Document Retrieval**  \n",
    "    For each sub-query, we retrieve _m_ relevant documents from the knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Re-ranking with RRF**  \n",
    "    All retrieved documents are re-ranked using the Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) algorithm, which aggregates scores across queries to prioritize the most relevant content.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fusion and Response Generation**  \n",
    "    The top fused documents and the set of sub-queries are provided to the LLM, which synthesizes a detailed and factual answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üõ†Ô∏è Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-query Expansion:** Improves recall by exploring diverse phrasings of the user's question.\n",
    "- **RRF-based Fusion:** Robustly combines evidence from multiple retrievals ([see paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03367)).\n",
    "- **LLM-powered Synthesis:** Generates comprehensive answers grounded in retrieved evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üì¶ Example Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user_query = \"What is Amazon AWS?\"\n",
    "response = Fusion_RAG_Pipeline(user_query)\n",
    "print(response)\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",

    "## ‚ú® Why Use Fusion RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "- üîç **Better Coverage:** Multiple queries ensure broader information retrieval.\n",
    "- üèÜ **Improved Ranking:** RRF fusion surfaces the most relevant documents.\n",
    "- ü§ñ **LLM Integration:** Final answers are both accurate and contextually rich.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Prepare your document corpus in the `data/` directory.\n",
    "2. Run the notebook cells in order.\n",
    "3. Use `Fusion_RAG_Pipeline(your_query)` to get high-quality, fused responses!\n",
